# Claude Development Notes

## Best Practices Reminders
- **Stay Updated**: Always check for latest versions and installation methods
- **Don't Assume**: Verify current practices before implementing
- **Modern Tools**: Use Vite instead of create-react-app for React projects

## Tailwind CSS Setup Fix
**Issue**: Tailwind v4 was installed but not working due to configuration mismatch
**Solution**: 
1. Uninstalled Tailwind v4: `npm uninstall tailwindcss`
2. Installed stable v3: `npm install -D tailwindcss@^3 postcss autoprefixer`  
3. Initialized config: `npx tailwindcss init -p`
4. Updated tailwind.config.js to use CommonJS: `module.exports = {}`
5. PostCSS config auto-generated correctly

## Current Project Status
- ✅ Vite + React + TypeScript setup complete
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v3 properly configured with PostCSS
- ✅ CSV Parser implementation complete
- ✅ All data transformation features complete
- ✅ Basic chart visualization with Recharts complete
- ✅ Context API refactoring complete - eliminated prop drilling

## Architecture Improvements
**Context API Implementation (Latest)**:
- Created `DataExplorerContext` for centralized state management
- Eliminated prop drilling (ControlPanel went from 12+ props to 0 props)
- All state and computed values centralized in context
- Clean separation of concerns between state management and UI components
- Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
